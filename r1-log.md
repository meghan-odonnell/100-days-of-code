completed 2 kata on codewars. One was easy and one was tricky and took me a while to figure out. 
It involved for each loops and sorting a list and converting to an array.

Cleared up some errors and now I'm figuring out how to render the JSON image response

like assigning two variables in the same line with split().

## R1D11 - May 26

I got my base 64 image word cloud to display in Vue! And I see that there is a JavaScript package for word clouds, 
so I'll play around with that next and get my data from the LOTR API feeding properly üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #API #theOneAPItoRuleThemAll

## R1D12 - May 27

Watched some videos on D3.js for the WordCloud and decided to stick with the API version.
And I cleaned up some details in the API service and component and those work now. 
Definitely was overcomplicating it and repeating code.

## R1D13 - May 28

Getting the text variable to pass to the WordCloud API and update. 
Now trying to get the LOTR to return data and reviewing methods for sending API keys in the call.

## R1D14 - May 29

Reading up on best practices for handling multiple APIs and API key security. the LOTR API is returning 
data to the component, but not displaying, and I'm getting a websocket connection error, so I'll look into that. 

## R1D15 - May 30

I got the LOTR data to display - Well, I wasn't accessing the response data correctly (it's an array of objects). 

## R1D16 - May 31

Listening to a coding podcast today as I drive to a friend's.
